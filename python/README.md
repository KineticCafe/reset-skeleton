## Python Reset

Implement a set class (called Reset) that corresponds to the behaviours
that would be expected from a mathematical set. Do not use Pythonâ€™s built-in
set type.

### Basic setup

This requires only Python (version 2 or 3).
To run the tests:

```bash
$ python test.py
```

### Structure

Tests are in `test.py`
Reset class is in `reset/reset.py`

### Notes

Initial version has a single failing test to validate tests are running

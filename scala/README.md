## Scala Reset

Implement a set class (called NewSet) that corresponds to the behaviours
that would be expected from a mathematical set. Do not use Scalaâ€™s built-in
set type.

### Basic setup

This requires Scala and SBT.

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install -y scala sbt
```

To run the tests:

```bash
$ sbt test
```

### Structure

Tests are in `src/test`
Reset class is in `src/main/scala-2.11/org/kineticcafe/NewSetSpec.scala`

### Notes

Initial version has a single failing test to validate tests are running
